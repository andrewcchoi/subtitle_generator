1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 The End

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The End

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 The End

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 The End

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Isaac Hickentude, do you take Nigel to be your husband?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 I don't. And you couldn't have told me this an hour ago.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Her name is Patience. She's a lady that lives in the ground.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 What? Who was that?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 We were once stuck and whole.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 We decided we had to join hands

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
 and navigate our way through the dirt

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
 to the Woodstone basement.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We agreed that Sass would lead the way,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 then Thor, then myself.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
 There was another ghost in the hole with us.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
 Her name was Patience. She was a Puritan.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 What happened to her?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,500
 Isaac sneezed and let go of Patience's hand.

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 For all we know, she's still out there roaming.

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 So you're telling me there's a Puritan woman

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
 just out there wandering around in the dirt?

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 Yes.

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 Mm-mm. I don't like that one bit.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
 You really should have invited us to the wedding, Isaac.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 He's here, Patience.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 God bless you.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Oh!

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Patience.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 The council has met, and we've decided that we'd like you to leave the community.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 What? But I'm the most pious among us.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Who experiences less joy than I? Who is more severe?

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 You are joyless and severe, I agree.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 But even for us, Puritans are such a thing as too severe.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I mean, you wanted us to execute Miss Elizabeth Prue.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,299
 She was talking to a doll, tis surely a sign of witchcraft.

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,299
 She's five.

37
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,500
 And on a path most dark.

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,000
 The point is you have to leave, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,300
 Then fine.

40
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,300
 I shall start my own colony,

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
 where there will be no smiling, no laughter,

42
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
 and all the handles of the butter churns shall be rough-hewn,

43
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,300
 so that thou shalt feel the pain of sin with every stroke.

44
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 Well,

45
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,000
 I think people are going to really enjoy that.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,140
 Or not enjoy it, whatever you wish.

47
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,140
 Anyway, banishment next.

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:11,659
 Oh, man, I feel bad about Isaac leaving Nigel at the altar last night.

49
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:13,680
 But what a show.

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
 Indeed.

51
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,500
 At least it was a break from the crushing mundanity of our bleak existence.

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 Okay, the water bill this month is unusually high.

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,340
 Just like that. We're back.

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,539
 Jay, have you been taking long showers or something?

55
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,300
 You think I'm taking long showers?

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,840
 I got a bunch of invisible people creeping on me.

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,379
 I wear a bathing suit in there.

58
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,419
 People are so uptight about nudity.

59
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,539
 And the cult we used to take group showers.

60
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:38,180
 We really help to clean those hard-to-reach places.

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,020
 Quick, some of them were water built up?

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,479
 Hey, guys. Got those tile samples for the restaurant.

63
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,520
 Mark and I just went to the hardware store.

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
 Because I can leave the property?

65
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
 We know, Pete.

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,759
 This one's perfect. Right here. Final answer. Lock it in.

67
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,299
 Well, okay. That was easy.

68
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,340
 It's usually a whole weird song and dance with you two.

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,639
 Well, we should confirm it with our investor.

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,259
 Right, our silent partner.

71
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,939
 But do you really think he needs to weigh in on such a little thing?

72
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:03,479
 Yes, I think he would be very upset if we didn't loop him in.

73
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,399
 Yeah, that's more what I expected.

74
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,239
 Anyway, our supplier said he's almost out of these,

75
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,739
 so if we want them, we gotta act fast.

76
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,620
 See? So let's ask Isaac, okay? Is he in here?

77
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,579
 No. Have any of you guys seen him?

78
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,419
 Hmm, no. He must still be moping in this room.

79
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,780
 Oh, poor guy. But it was exciting for us.

80
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,120
 Oh, the drama! The smell of the hors d'oeuvres!

81
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,280
 The camaraderie, the sharing of the soul.

82
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,780
 And she's back on group showers.

83
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
 He wasn't at the hardware store,

84
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,280
 because he can't leave the property, which I can.

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,780
 What'd they say?

86
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,280
 They haven't seen him. I hope he's doing okay.

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,780
 I'm sure he's fine.

88
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
 Okay, okay, you know what?

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,780
 Let's just address the elephant in the room.

90
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
 You're upset with me.

91
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,780
 Patience! Patience!

92
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
 That's new.

93
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,780
 Thou didst abandon me.

94
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
 It was an accident!

95
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,240
 I had to sneeze, and so I covered my nose.

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,800
 And in doing so, I did let go of your hand

97
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,420
 and abandoned you to the dirt.

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,139
 The point is, I was wrong.

99
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,660
 And I apologize.

100
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,000
 Tis my intention to push thee into the dirt

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,719
 such that thou may know the century of suffering

102
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,960
 patience has endured.

103
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,379
 What?

104
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:08,860
 Patience!

105
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:10,740
 Hey.

106
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,340
 Sorry, um, have you seen Isaac?

107
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,000
 The marksman who only yesterday pierced my heart for a second time?

108
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,920
 No, I can't say that I have.

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,879
 But, in a grander sense, I'm not sure I've ever seen the real Isaac.

110
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:28,800
 I'm sorry, Nigel. This is really hard.

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,420
 Nigel's still living in the house? I thought he would have slunk back to the shed.

112
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,560
 Dammit, Jay.

113
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,519
 What? Didn't Isaac, like, totally ditch him at the altar?

114
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,500
 Well, we'll leave you alone.

115
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,259
 and those of us who possess the ability to close doors will do so.

116
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,459
 No!

117
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,459
 Can you turn on the TV already?

118
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,100
 It's not called 45 minutes.

119
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,379
 Someone watch the full 60.

120
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,800
 Okay, it's not just like pressing a button.

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
 I mean, it is.

122
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,259
 But it's hard, and it's impressive that I can do it at all.

123
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,100
 Possible Trevor's somehow growing weaker over time.

124
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,439
 Legs are looking a little smaller.

125
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,819
 What? No.

126
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,939
 That's not even physically possible.

127
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,319
 Hey, have you guys seen Isaac?

128
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
 I haven't seen him.

129
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,319
 Me neither.

130
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,319
 Not since wet English went very bad.

131
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,319
 Nancy, have you seen Isaac?

132
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,319
 Isaac?

133
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,319
 You know, now that you mention it, I think he said he was going for a stroll this morning.

134
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,319
 Mm-hmm.

135
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,319
 And I remember that because when he said stroll, I was looking at a bull and I was like,

136
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,319
 whoa, stroll and bull, what are the chances?

137
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,319
 What?

138
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,579
 when he'd be back?

139
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,860
 I'm sorry, I didn't get his life story.

140
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,560
 Jeez, what's with the third degree, huh?

141
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,959
 Why are you being so weird?

142
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,360
 I'm not being weird.

143
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,759
 You're being weird.

144
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,159
 Quit taking your body issues out on me, chicken legs.

145
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,399
 I don't have to taste it.

146
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,379
 Interesting.

147
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,300
 Nancy seems like she's hiding something.

148
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,240
 Okay, you listen here, Nancy, and you listen good.

149
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,379
 She left, Jay.

150
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,219
 Why am I even along on this mission?

151
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,319
 Please, Patience. I'm sorry.

152
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,879
 I didn't mean to lose you.

153
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,819
 I did look for you.

154
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:17,019
 A few times I even ventured slightly into the dirt.

155
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,560
 No, you wouldn't.

156
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,159
 Not for patience.

157
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,659
 Are you kidding?

158
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,860
 I missed you.

159
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
 We all missed you.

160
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,980
 Me, Sass, Thor, the entire...

161
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,779
 whole patrol.

162
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,680
 I mean, we had some good times, right?

163
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,680
 Remember when Thor tried to say the word supposedly

164
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,680
 and instead said supposedly?

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,420
 It was indeed quite amusing.

166
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,680
 And I don't know about you, but I loved our time in the ditch.

167
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,699
 I mean, who wouldn't enjoy staring at that gorgeous porcelain skin?

168
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,420
 It is from the bloodletting that killed me.

169
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,019
 I'm just glad we get to hang again.

170
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,779
 Although, similarly to how Thor, Sass, and I miss being in the ditch with you,

171
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,899
 I do fear I might miss being with them.

172
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,579
 You see what I mean, Patience?

173
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,399
 Isaac is lonely.

174
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,100
 Exactly.

175
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,660
 I miss my friends.

176
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,980
 You can understand that, right?

177
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,580
 Oh, patience understand.

178
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,240
 Patience.

179
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:18,540
 Patience.

180
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,100
 Great.

181
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,580
 Isaac.

182
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,000
 Isaac.

183
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,560
 Nancy, out with it.

184
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,439
 What happened to Isaac?

185
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,900
 I don't know why you guys are riding my leg about this.

186
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
 I have no idea where he is.

187
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,620
 Okay, I had promised not to say anything,

188
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,540
 but Nancy already told me what happened.

189
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,240
 You told him about patience?

190
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,300
 Wait.

191
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
 What happened with Patience?

192
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,800
 Oh, damn it, Stuart.

193
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 You have to be the dumbest, most gullible piece of trash

194
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,300
 I've ever known, and I was married to the village idiot.

195
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,800
 Come on, Nancy. What happened?

196
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 Okay. So yesterday, attracted by the pulsing bass

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 from the wedding DJ's speakers,

198
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
 Patience appeared through the wall.

199
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,300
 She asked to speak to Isaac, so we arranged a meeting.

200
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,300
 We thought she just wanted to yell at him a little.

201
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
 We didn't know she was gonna drag him away.

202
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,800
 It was very rude.

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,560
 We were mad about not being invited to the wedding,

204
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,480
 but we didn't want this to happen!

205
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
 Jay, a quick update.

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,480
 Isaac was kidnapped by a Puritan ghost

207
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,180
 who's been roaming the dirt for centuries,

208
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,819
 waiting for a chance at revenge.

209
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,319
 Oh, that's really gonna push back

210
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,280
 and answer on these tiles.

211
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,780
 Obviously, I'm also very concerned for Isaac.

212
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,280
 Thor confused how Patience just take Isaac.

213
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,360
 Not like she's strong enough to lift Isaac Dover's shoulder.

214
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,700
 Probably be something you struggle with as well.

215
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,060
 I broke a Thighmaster once, Thor. I broke it.

216
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,319
 Patience is real stealth. I'll show you.

217
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,359
 I'll be Patience, and Sass, you be Isaac, okay?

218
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,359
 See, he was standing over there.

219
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,939
 Right here?

220
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,939
 Yep, but his back was to the wall.

221
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,439
 Like this?

222
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:50,939
 Exactly. Then all of a sudden...

223
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,279
 Patience!

224
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,279
 Whoo!

225
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,379
 Okay, you gotta believe me.

226
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,219
 We did not know that was gonna happen.

227
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,059
 Surprise!

228
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,059
 Patience! What is the meaning of this?

229
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,059
 Thou didst say that thou missed thy friends.

230
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,059
 Tis now a problem solved.

231
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:17,059
 Wait, did I get kidnapped because Isaac said he was lonely?

232
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,059
 No! I have been vastly misunderstood.

233
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,059
 And also she has gone quite mad.

234
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,059
 Isaac didst inform me how much you searched for Patience

235
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,059
 all those years ago.

236
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,059
 It was a relief on account of how much I did see thee as friends.

237
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:34,059
 Uh... same.

238
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,019
 Oh, I never had such friends as in the ditch.

239
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,619
 And now we have another chance.

240
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:41,899
 Huzzah.

241
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,379
 It is ordained.

242
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:47,679
 We shall spend the remainder of eternity here together.

243
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:51,439
 Now, it is time for my daily constitutional.

244
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,839
 It took me a century to get my bearings here in the dirt,

245
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,539
 so don't you go wandering off, lest she be lost forever.

246
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:04,539
 Oh, this sucks.

247
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,539
 Yeah.

248
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,539
 Okay, Flower, you spoke with Patience

249
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,539
 while you were in the well.

250
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,539
 Do you recall her saying anything

251
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,539
 that could help us locate Isaac and Sass?

252
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:14,539
 Don't love that Flower's memory's load-bearing here.

253
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:16,539
 Okay, let me think.

254
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:19,539
 It's interesting, because Patience has taken Isaac,

255
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:20,539
 and now Sass.

256
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,539
 It's almost like she's abducting everyone

257
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,539
 that was in the ditch with her,

258
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,539
 which just leaves Thor.

259
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,379
 Huh?

260
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,079
 Yeah, she could be coming for you next, big guy.

261
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,379
 The final piece to her creepy little puzzle.

262
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:34,379
 I'd like to see her try.

263
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:35,879
 Though not scared.

264
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,879
 Oh, wait, I do remember something about Patience.

265
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,719
 Mm.

266
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,719
 She was small.

267
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,719
 She had no arms and legs.

268
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,219
 She was a worm.

269
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,059
 There was a worm named Patience?

270
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,360
 Yeah, I named her after this other Patience I met.

271
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
 She's a Puritan.

272
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,059
 And we're in the vicinity.

273
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,559
 Do you know where we can find the Puritan?

274
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,559
 Yes, Patience said something about living in a cave

275
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,559
 underneath a willow.

276
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,559
 Okay, Flowers said that Sass and Isaac are under a willow.

277
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,559
 Is there a willow tree on the property?

278
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,559
 Yeah, remember? That's where I crashed my drone

279
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,559
 that looks like a TIE fighter.

280
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,559
 TIE fighter's from Star Wars.

281
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,559
 Star Wars is a futuristic space opera.

282
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,559
 Well, actually, it was set in a distant past.

283
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,559
 This is worse than Samantha's water bill talk.

284
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,559
 What are we waiting for, huh? Let's go get him.

285
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,559
 Get who?

286
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,559
 What the hell?

287
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,559
 Four not scared, Thor. Just surprised.

288
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,559
 Subtle but important difference.

289
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,559
 Maybe being imprisoned in this dank lair

290
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,559
 with that interminable dripping is my comeuppance.

291
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,559
 What are you talking about?

292
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,559
 I've disappointed everyone who's ever depended on me.

293
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,559
 I was a bad fiancé in death, a bad husband in life.

294
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,559
 Let this be my promise to you, my friend.

295
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,559
 If, by the grace of God, we ever get out of here,

296
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,559
 I vow to change my ways.

297
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,759
 to be kinder, to be less selfish,

298
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,279
 to be a better person.

299
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,199
 Good for you.

300
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,239
 Your rock looks more comfortable, can I have it?

301
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:03,000
 What happened to being a better person?

302
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,239
 What? Oh, no, no, no, I said if.

303
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,319
 If we get out of here,

304
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,159
 God has to uphold his end of the bargain first.

305
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,779
 I can't believe we're in this situation.

306
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,579
 Who knows what that lunatic has in store for us.

307
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,599
 Honestly, I'd like to say that she became terrible

308
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,899
 because of the isolation,

309
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,179
 but she was always a little off to begin with.

310
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,399
 Patience, patience.

311
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,139
 Your version's too sane.

312
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,299
 Ever, patience.

313
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:28,299
 Oh yeah, that's it.

314
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,139
 That was good.

315
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,340
 That one really captured the madness.

316
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,879
 That wasn't me, Isaac.

317
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,720
 Patience, what's up girl?

318
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,220
 I'm tired and my hands hurt.

319
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,680
 Yeah, sorry I couldn't find that second shovel, Jay.

320
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,100
 You throw behind the shed, Sam.

321
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,180
 How it going?

322
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,620
 Thor, get over here.

323
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,600
 All good in this open space with clear views of all approaches,

324
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,279
 but not scared.

325
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,320
 Oh, I think he broke through.

326
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,440
 Sam, I think I broke through.

327
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,320
 Do you see anything?

328
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,360
 Sus!

329
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,320
 Isaac!

330
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,040
 Trevor, arrow guy.

331
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,620
 Oh, this is fun naming everyone.

332
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,540
 Oh, it's a burrow of rabbits.

333
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,180
 No, Ghost, they're not in there.

334
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,160
 Patience ain't in there.

335
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,819
 You can stop cowering, Thor.

336
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,519
 And your hat's small and ugly like Trevor's legs.

337
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:21,399
 Two for one.

338
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,939
 Boom!

339
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:22,939
 Wait a minute.

340
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,799
 Patience never said she lived under a willow.

341
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:29,559
 The Grateful Dead said we could all get high under a willow

342
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,980
 in the song Sugar Magnolia,

343
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,879
 which wasn't released until after I died.

344
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:35,500
 But Bobby Weir used to sing it to us in the shower.

345
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,139
 They're not in there, Jay.

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,120
 You know what that means.

347
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,319
 We're digging in the wrong place.

348
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:41,939
 Raiders.

349
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,000
 Did Pete do the Raiders thing?

350
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,699
 Our friends are still being held hostage,

351
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,360
 but yes, Jay, he did the Raiders thing.

352
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
 My guy.

353
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,500
 I want it to be nice.

354
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,000
 But no one's nice to Patience.

355
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,120
 There's only one thing to do, yes.

356
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,720
 One thing to do.

357
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,040
 Forget this ever happened and start over with a clean slate?

358
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,920
 Take thee into the dirt.

359
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,759
 And when you say thee, do you mean me thee or he thee?

360
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,580
 Both.

361
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,820
 Don't love that.

362
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,560
 Ah!

363
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:14,500
 Three, two, one, shoot!

364
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,419
 Yeah!

365
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,099
 What was that? You just made a fist.

366
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,299
 That is what rock is, Stuart.

367
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:23,339
 The rules are so simple, you're killing me.

368
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:26,619
 The sexual tension between these two.

369
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:27,739
 It's palpable.

370
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,159
 Will they or won't they?

371
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,739
 Just put us out of our misery.

372
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,019
 Oh, God, earth's gross!

373
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,859
 Oh, that is so scary and disgusting.

374
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,959
 I'm pretty sure a worm went right through my mouth.

375
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,460
 Oh, she's back and she wants more!

376
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,300
 Here take him, he's not annoying!

377
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
 No!

378
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
 I am returning them.

379
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,600
 Thou art free to go.

380
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,300
 Wait, really?

381
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,800
 W-why?

382
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,300
 Tis mine own fault for thinking you actually liked me.

383
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,220
 Patience shall return to her one true friend.

384
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,720
 The dirt.

385
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
 Why does paper beat rock?

386
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
 Do I run into the dirt?

387
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 Gah!

388
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
 I've got it.

389
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
 Patient said she was living in a white room

390
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 with black curtains.

391
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,720
 No, wait, that's from a bath I took with the band cream.

392
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
 This is painful.

393
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,720
 If legs hurt from standing, you could have the whole seat.

394
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
 I was talking about flower. The legs are great.

395
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
 We have returned.

396
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,720
 Oh! How did you escape?

397
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
 Did you brave the dirt?

398
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
 Or did you have to do something you can never talk about?

399
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 You can tell Bertie. Bertie keeps her mouth shut.

400
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,019
 Actually, she just let us go.

401
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,519
 Sasapi's hurt her feelings.

402
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,759
 Me? You did it too.

403
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,259
 But you started it by imitating her.

404
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,560
 Patience. Patience.

405
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,259
 That's a thing she does now.

406
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,139
 It's nuts.

407
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,840
 Look, I'm glad to be back, but I don't know, man.

408
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,700
 I feel like she needed friends, and we abandoned her.

409
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,000
 Just like we did 130 years ago.

410
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,680
 Patience!

411
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,019
 I'm not even exaggerating. That is literally what it is.

412
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,519
 She is loony.

413
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,019
 Well, I think we figured out what's up with the water bills.

414
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,519
 Mark says the fountain is leaking.

415
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,359
 Just hundreds of dollars dripping into the ground.

416
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,399
 And the fascinating saga of the water bill continues.

417
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,359
 Will they patch the pipes? Stay tuned.

418
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,539
 Babe, Sass and Isaac escaped Patience's clutches.

419
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:24,359
 They're back.

420
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,659
 Oh, nice.

421
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,379
 You see, sometimes this ghost stuff just resolves itself.

422
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,779
 That's a good lesson for the future.

423
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,079
 Wait a minute. Dripping?

424
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,379
 Isaac, remember the dripping in Patience's lair?

425
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,379
 Patience's lair must be under the fountain.

426
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,379
 What? She's been 50 feet away this entire time?

427
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:40,379
 Oh, now that creeps me all the way out.

428
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,379
 You know, if Patience's feelings were really hurt,

429
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:46,379
 now you can do something about it. We know where she is.

430
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,379
 Hey, just to clarify, are you suggesting going and getting

431
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,379
 the creepy, feral Puritan ghost and bringing her into the house?

432
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,379
 I'm suggesting righting a wrong that happened a long time ago.

433
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,379
 Wow, and you wouldn't even let me get a lizard.

434
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:03,220
 May I just remind you that this lunatic kidnapped

435
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,960
 and held us hostage.

436
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,380
 She was hurting, Isaac, and also she let us go.

437
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,460
 Wait, you were kidnapped by a worm?

438
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,420
 I may regret this, but I feel we need to go get Patience.

439
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,700
 Patience is very creepy,

440
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,359
 but for no pain of abandonment,

441
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,539
 would not wish that on any Nandane.

442
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,400
 Isaac, you were literally just saying

443
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,980
 that if we got out of there, you'd turn over a new leaf

444
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,480
 and be a better person.

445
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,980
 Well, here's your chance.

446
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,480
 Yes, perhaps we could start with something smaller.

447
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,980
 I could compliment one of Samantha's dreadful sweaters.

448
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,980
 That looks...

449
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
 lovely.

450
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
 Isaac!

451
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,980
 Okay, fine, fine.

452
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,980
 Let's go get that scary Puritan woman.

453
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
 Jay, we may need to destroy the fountain, but...

454
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
 Please don't finish that sentence.

455
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,980
 No. I got a better idea.

456
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,980
 I'm a guy with great legs and a great idea.

457
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:04,140
 Wow, Jay, this is actually really cool.

458
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,819
 They formed a human chain, or, you know, a ghost chain.

459
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,539
 Once again, Sam, we're still human. We're just dead.

460
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:13,019
 This is the most amazing sight I've never seen.

461
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,960
 You see, back at Camper Ma, I was anchor of my tug-of-war team.

462
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,660
 Three years running, we got first to the Maccabia games.

463
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,519
 Okay.

464
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,500
 I'll take Crash's hand.

465
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,660
 At least we know he cannot sneeze.

466
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:26,579
 Yeah, keep going. Into the dirt.

467
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,539
 I hate this!

468
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,980
 Whoa! Now stop, stop, stop. Pull out! Pull out!

469
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,980
 No, the ghost got pulled into the dirt.

470
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
 Oh, no.

471
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,980
 Yes! Steve Money and his magic quads!

472
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
 Suck it, Thor!

473
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
 Thor's way up there.

474
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
 Pass it on!

475
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,980
 Suck it, Thor! Pass it on!

476
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
 Suck it, Thor! Pass it on!

477
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
 Suck it, Thor! Pass it on!

478
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,980
 Patience! We came back.

479
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,980
 Isaacs, Sasapis, what is the meaning of this?

480
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,980
 We're not gonna abandon you again.

481
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
 Come with us.

482
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
 Oh, sorry! Sorry!

483
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,980
 I got him! We're good. We're good.

484
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,980
 Look, we know we messed up, but you're our friend.

485
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,980
 And you're not a lunatic.

486
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,980
 My point is we would like you to come back to the house with us.

487
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,980
 You came back for me?

488
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,480
 Not soon enough.

489
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,980
 Patience! Patience!

490
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,480
 Oh, so it can be good or bad. That's interesting.

491
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
 Mm-hmm.

492
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
 Come with me if you want to live.

493
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,480
 Terminator. It's a movie.

494
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
 A movie's like a series of images.

495
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
 Can we do this back at the house?

496
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,980
 Suck it, Thor!

497
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,480
 Pass it on.

498
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
 Wait.

499
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:58,720
 Hey, Jay, if I were kidnapped and trapped in an underground lair, would you risk an eternity

500
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
 in the dirt for the chance to save me?

501
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 Ooh, of course.

502
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,240
 And I love that these are our hypotheticals.

503
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
 Well?

504
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
 Oh, sorry, bro.

505
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,420
 It's a no-go on the tiles.

506
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,539
 Our investor wants to see other options.

507
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:12,539
 I mean, Burgundy.

508
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,599
 Are we opening a restaurant or a brothel?

509
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,599
 Okay.

510
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,960
 I'll find some more options.

511
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
 Sorry, Mark.

512
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,960
 By the way, how's Patience adapting to life in the house?

513
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 I think it's going really well.

514
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
 One last question for thee.

515
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
 What is thy favorite color?

516
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 Ugh, I do not sign up for this.

517
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
 Patience! Patience!

518
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
 Ah! Purple!

519
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
 Oh.

520
00:20:48,960 --> 00:21:18,940
 Thank you.

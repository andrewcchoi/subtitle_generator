1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The End

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The End

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Isaac Hickentude, do you take Nigel to be your husband?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't. And you couldn't have told me this an hour ago.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Her name is Patience. She's a lady that lives in the ground.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What? Who was that?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We were once stuck and whole.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We decided we had to join hands and navigate our way through the dirt to the Woodstone basement.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We agreed that Sass would lead the way, then Thor, then myself.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There was another ghost in the hole with us. Her name was Patience. She was a Puritan.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What happened to her?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Isaac sneezed and let go of Patience's hand.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For all we know, she's still out there roaming.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So you're telling me there's a Puritan woman just out there wandering around in the dirt?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Mm-mm. I don't like that one bit.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You really should have invited us to the wedding, Isaac.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He's here, Patience.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
God bless you.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh!

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Patience. The council has met and we've decided that we'd like you to leave the community.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What? But I'm the most pious among us. Who experiences less joy than I? Who is more severe?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are joyless and severe, I agree. But even for us Puritans, there's such a thing as too severe.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I mean, you wanted us to execute Miss Elizabeth Prue.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
She was talking to a doll. Tis surely a sign of witchcraft.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
She's five.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And on a path most dark.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The point is you have to leave. I'm sorry.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then fine. I shall start my own colony where there will be no smiling, no laughter, and all the handles of the butter churns shall be rough hewn so that thou shalt feel the pain of sin with every stroke.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, I think people are going to really enjoy that. Or not enjoy it. Whatever you wish. Anyway, banishment next.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Man, I feel bad about Isaac leaving Nigel at the altar last night. But what a show.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Indeed. At least it was a break from the crushing mundanity of our bleak existence.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, the water bill this month is unusually high.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And just like that, we're back.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jay, have you been taking long showers or something?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You think I'm taking long showers? I got a bunch of invisible people creeping on me. I wear a bathing suit in there.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
People are so uptight about nudity. And the cult we used to take group showers. We really help to clean those hard to reach places.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Quick, some of them were water bill talk?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey guys, got those tile samples for the restaurant.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mark and I just went to the hardware store.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because I can leave the property?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We know, Pete.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This one's perfect. Right here. Final answer. Lock it in.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, okay. That was easy. It's usually a whole weird song and dance with you two.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, we should confirm it with our investor.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right. Our silent partner. But do you really think he needs to weigh in on such a little thing?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes. I think he would be very upset if we didn't loop him in.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, that's more what I expected.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Anyway, our supplier said he's almost out of these. So if we want them, we gotta act fast.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
See? So let's ask Isaac, okay? Is he in here?

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No. Have any of you guys seen him?

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hmm, no. He must still be moping in this room. Oh, poor guy. But it was exciting for us.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, the drama! The smell of the orders!

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Where was the camaraderie? The sharing of the soul?

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And she's back on group showers.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He wasn't at the hardware store because he can't leave the property, which I can.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What'd they say?

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They haven't seen him. I hope he's doing okay.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ah, I'm sure he's fine.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, okay, you know what? Let's just address the elephant in the room.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're upset with me.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Patience! Patience!

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's new.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Patience!

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Patience!

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey! Sorry. Um...

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Have you seen Isaac?

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The marksman who only yesterday pierced my heart for a second time?

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll be in touch, sincerentity.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't look back to the shed.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, thank you, Giovanni Reu curb Chadwick's km of his past.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:28,000
've been treated that hag-

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go ahead.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,399
he would have slunk back to the shed.

90
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,800
Ah.

91
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Damn it, Jay.

92
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,699
What? Didn't Isaac, like, totally ditch him at the altar?

93
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,500
Ah.

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,300
Well, we'll leave you alone.

95
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Those of us who possess the ability to close doors will do so.

96
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,000
Ah.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,399
Can you turn on the TV already?

98
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,100
It's not called 45 minutes.

99
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,300
Someone watch the full 60.

100
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,899
Okay, it's not just, like, pressing a button.

101
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,600
I mean, it is.

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,199
But it's hard, and it's impressive that I can do it at all.

103
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,000
Possible Trevor somehow growing weaker over time.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,399
Legs are looking a little smaller.

105
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,000
What?

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,699
No.

107
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,899
That's not even physically possible.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,399
Hey, have you guys seen Isaac?

109
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,500
I haven't seen him.

110
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,199
Me neither.

111
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,500
Not since wedding, which went very bad.

112
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,599
Nancy?

113
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,399
Have you seen Isaac?

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Isaac?

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ah.

116
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,300
You know, now that you mention it,

117
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,000
I think he said he was going for a stroll this morning.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Mm-hmm.

119
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
And I remember that because when he said stroll,

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
I was looking at a bull, and I was like,

121
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
whoa, stroll and bull?

122
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,100
What are the chances?

123
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,900
What?

124
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,500
Did he say when he'd be back?

125
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,100
I didn't get his life story.

127
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,900
Jeez, what's with the third degree, huh?

128
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,199
Why are you being so weird?

129
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,699
I'm not being weird.

130
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,100
You're being weird.

131
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,500
Quit taking your body issues out on me, chicken legs.

132
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,699
I don't have to taste it.

133
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,199
No.

134
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,699
Interesting.

135
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,500
Nancy seems like she's hiding something.

136
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,199
Okay.

137
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,500
You listen here, Nancy, and you listen good.

138
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,699
She left, Jay.

139
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,699
Why am I even along on this mission?

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,500
Please, patience.

141
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,199
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,800
I didn't mean to lose you.

143
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,199
I-I did look for you.

144
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,199
A few times, I even ventured slightly into the dirt.

145
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,699
No, you wouldn't.

146
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,600
Not for patience.

147
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,699
Are you kidding?

148
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:22,899
I missed you.

149
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,899
We all missed you.

150
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,899
Me, Sass, Thor, the entire...

151
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,899
whole patrol.

152
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,899
I mean, we had some good times, right?

153
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,899
Remember when Thor tried to say the word supposedly

154
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,899
and instead said supposedly?

155
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:42,899
It was indeed quite amusing.

156
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:45,899
And I don't know about you, but I loved our time in the ditch.

157
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,099
I mean, who wouldn't enjoy staring at that gorgeous porcelain skin?

158
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:52,099
It is from the bloodletting that killed me.

159
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:56,099
I'm just glad we get to hang again.

160
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,599
Although, similarly to how Thor, Sass, and I miss being in the ditch with you,

161
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,099
I do fear I might miss being with them.

162
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,099
You see what I mean, patience?

163
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,099
Isaac is lonely.

164
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,099
Exactly.

165
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,099
I miss my friends.

166
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,099
You can understand that, right?

167
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,300
Oh, patience, understand.

168
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Patience.

169
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Patience.

170
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Great.

171
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Isaac.

172
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Isaac.

173
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Nancy, out with it.

174
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
What happened to Isaac?

175
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,300
I don't know why you guys are riding my leg about this.

176
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
I have no idea where he is.

177
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Okay, I had promised not to say anything, but Nancy already told me what happened.

178
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
You told him about patience?

179
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Wait.

180
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,900
What happened with patience?

181
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,300
Oh, damn it, Stuart.

182
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,500
Stuart, you have to be the dumbest, most gullible piece of trash I've ever known, and I was

183
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
married to the village idiot.

184
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Come on, Nancy.

185
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
What happened?

186
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Okay.

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,500
So, yesterday, attracted by the pulsing bass from the wedding DJ's speakers, patience

188
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
appeared through the wall.

189
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
She asked to speak to Isaac, so we arranged a meeting.

190
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
We thought she just wanted to yell at him a little.

191
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
We didn't know she was going to drag him away.

192
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,699
It was very rude.

193
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,699
We were mad about not being invited to the wedding, but we didn't want this to happen.

194
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,699
Jay, a quick update.

195
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,699
Isaac was kidnapped by a Puritan ghost who's been roaming the dirt for centuries, waiting

196
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,699
for a chance at revenge.

197
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,699
Oh, that's really going to push back and answer on these tiles.

198
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,699
Obviously, I'm also very concerned for Isaac.

199
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,699
Thor confused how patience just take Isaac.

200
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,699
Not like she's strong enough to lift Isaac Dover's shoulder.

201
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,899
Probably be something you struggle with as well.

202
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,500
I broke a Thighmaster once, Thor.

203
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I broke it.

204
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,700
Patience is real stealth.

205
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
I'll show you.

206
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,899
I'll be Patience, and, Sass, you be Isaac.

207
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:41,899
Okay?

208
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,899
See, he was standing over there.

209
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,899
Right here?

210
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,899
Yep, but his back was to the wall.

211
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:48,899
Like this?

212
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:49,899
Exactly.

213
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:50,899
Then all of a sudden...

214
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:51,899
Patience!

215
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:58,100
Okay, you gotta believe me.

216
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,100
We did not know that was gonna happen.

217
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Surprise!

218
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Patience!

219
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
What is the meaning of this?

220
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Thou didst say that thou missed thy friends.

221
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Tis now a problem solved.

222
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Wait, did I get kidnapped because Isaac said he was lonely?

223
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
No!

224
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
I have been vastly misunderstood.

225
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,300
And also she has gone quite mad.

226
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Okay?

227
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Isaac didst inform me how much you searched for Patience all those years ago.

228
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,300
It was a relief on account of how much I did see thee as friends.

229
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Uh...

230
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Same.

231
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Oh, I never had such friends as in the ditch!

232
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
And now we have another chance.

233
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Huzzah.

234
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
It is ordained.

235
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,300
We shall spend the remainder of eternity here together.

236
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,500
Now, it is time for my daily constitutional.

237
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
It took me a century to get my bearings here in the dirt.

238
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
So don't you go wandering off, lest she be lost forever.

239
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh, this sucks.

240
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Yeah.

241
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Okay, Flower, you spoke with Patience while you were in the well.

242
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Do you recall her saying anything that could help us locate Isaac and Sass?

243
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,700
Don't love the Flower's memories load-bearing here.

244
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Okay, let me think.

245
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,700
It's interesting because Patience has taken Isaac and now Sass.

246
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,700
It's almost like she's abducting everyone that was in the ditch with her.

247
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Which just leaves Thor.

248
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Uh-huh.

249
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Yeah, she could be coming for you next, big guy.

250
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
The final piece to her creepy little puzzle.

251
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,900
I would like to see her try.

252
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
Thor not scared.

253
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Oh, wait.

254
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
I do remember something about Patience.

255
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
She was small.

256
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
She had no arms and legs.

257
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
She was a worm.

258
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
There was a worm named Patience?

259
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
Yeah, I named her after this other Patience I met.

260
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
She's a Puritan.

261
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
And we're in the vicinity.

262
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Do you know where we can find the Puritan?

263
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,100
Yes, Patience said something about living in a cave underneath a willow.

264
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Okay, Flower said that Sass and Isaac are under a willow.

265
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Is there a willow tree on the property?

266
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Yeah, remember?

267
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
That's where I crashed my drone that looks like a TIE fighter.

268
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
TIE fighter's from Star Wars.

269
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Star Wars is a futuristic space opera.

270
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Well, actually, it was set in a distant past.

271
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
This is worse than Samantha's water bill talk.

272
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
What are we waiting for, huh?

273
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Let's go get him.

274
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Get who?

275
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
No!

276
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
What the hell?

277
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Full not scared, Thor.

278
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Just surprised.

279
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,300
Subtle but important difference.

280
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Maybe being imprisoned in this dank lair with that interminable dripping is my comeuppance.

281
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
What are you talking about?

282
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
I've disappointed everyone who's ever depended on me.

283
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,300
I was a bad fiancé in death, a bad husband in life.

284
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Let this be my promise to you, my friend.

285
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,300
If, by the grace of God, we ever get out of here, I vow to change my ways.

286
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:57,500
To be kinder, to be less selfish, to be a better person.

287
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Good for you.

288
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Your rock looks more comfortable.

289
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Can I have it?

290
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
What happened to being a better person?

291
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
What?

292
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Oh, no, no, no.

293
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I said if.

294
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
If we get out of here.

295
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
God has to uphold his end of the bargain first.

296
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,700
I can't believe her in this situation.

297
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Who knows what that lunatic has in store for us.

298
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Oh, honestly, I'd like to say that she became terrible because of the isolation, but she

299
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
was always a little off to begin with.

300
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Patience!

301
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Patience!

302
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Your version's too sane.

303
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Patience!

304
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Patience!

305
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
Oh, yeah, that's it.

306
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
That was good.

307
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
That one really captured the madness.

308
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
It wasn't me, Isaac.

309
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Patience!

310
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900
What's up, girl?

311
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
I'm tired and my hands hurt.

312
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,500
Yeah, sorry I couldn't find that second shovel, Jay.

313
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,900
You throw behind the sheds, Sam.

314
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Out going!

315
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Thor, get over here.

316
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:01,100
All good in this open space with clear views of all approaches, but not scared.

317
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Oh, I think he broke through.

318
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Sam, I think I broke through.

319
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Do you see anything?

320
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Sus!

321
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Isaac!

322
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Trevor!

323
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Arrow Guy!

324
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Oh, this is fun naming everyone.

325
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Oh, it's a burrow of rabbits.

326
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
No, ghost.

327
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
They're not in there.

328
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Patience ain't in there.

329
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
You can stop cowering, Thor.

330
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
And your hat's small and ugly like Trevor's legs.

331
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Two for one!

332
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Boom!

333
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Wait a minute.

334
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,300
Patience never said she lived under a willow.

335
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,100
The Grateful Dead said we could all get high under a willow in the song Sugar Magnolia,

336
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,100
which wasn't released until after I died, but Bobby Weir used to sing it to us in the shower.

337
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
They're not in there, Jay.

338
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,899
You know what that means.

339
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,300
We're digging in the wrong place.

340
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Raiders.

341
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Did Pete do the Raiders thing?

342
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,300
Our friends are still being held hostage, but yes, Jay, he did the Raiders thing.

343
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
My guy.

344
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,300
I want it to be nice.

345
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
But no one's nice to Patience.

346
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,500
There's only one thing to do.

347
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Yes.

348
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
One thing to do.

349
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,299
Forget this ever happened and start over with a clean slate?

350
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,299
Take thee into the dirt.

351
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,299
And when you say thee, do you mean me thee or he thee?

352
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,500
Both.

353
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Don't love that.

354
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,700
Three, two, one, shoot.

355
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Yeah.

356
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
What was that?

357
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
You just made a fist.

358
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
That is what rock is, Stuart.

359
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
The rules are so simple, you're killing me.

360
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
The sexual tension between these two.

361
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
It's palpable.

362
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Will they or won't they?

363
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Just put us out of our misery.

364
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Oh, my God.

365
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
That was gross.

366
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Oh, that is so scary and disgusting.

367
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
I'm pretty sure a worm went right through my mouth.

368
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,900
Oh, she's back and she wants more.

369
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Here, take him.

370
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
He's not annoying.

371
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
No.

372
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
I'm returning them.

373
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Thou art free to go.

374
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Wait.

375
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Really?

376
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Why?

377
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,100
Tis mine own fault for thinking you actually liked me.

378
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Patience shall return to her one true friend.

379
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
The dirt.

380
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Oh.

381
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Oh.

382
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh.

383
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Oh.

384
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Oh.

385
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Oh.

386
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Oh.

387
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Oh.

388
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Oh.

389
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Oh.

390
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Oh.

391
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Oh.

392
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Oh.

393
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Oh.

394
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Oh.

395
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Oh.

396
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Oh.

397
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Oh.

398
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Oh.

399
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Oh.

400
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Oh.

401
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Oh.

402
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,600
Oh.

403
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,399
Oh.

404
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,300
Oh, my god.

405
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
Why does paper beat rock?

406
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,000
Do I run into the dirt?

407
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,300
I got it.

408
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Patience said she was living in a white room with black curtains.

409
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
No.

410
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,800
Wait.

411
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,399
That's from a bath I took with the band cream.

412
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,100
This is painful.

413
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,600
If legs hurt from standing, you would have the whole seat.

414
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,300
I was talking about flour.

415
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,500
The legs are great.

416
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,200
We have returned.

417
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
Oh!

418
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,899
How did you escape?

419
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,500
Did you brave the dirt?

420
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,659
Or did you have to do something you can never talk about?

421
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,879
You can tell Birdie. Birdie keeps her mouth shut.

422
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,259
Actually, she just let us go.

423
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,600
Sasapi's hurt her feelings.

424
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,960
Me? You did it too.

425
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,639
But you started it by imitating her.

426
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,799
Patience. Patience.

427
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,220
That's a thing she does now. It's nuts.

428
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,980
Look, I'm glad to be back, but I don't know, man.

429
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,980
I feel like she needed friends, and we abandoned her.

430
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,019
Just like we did 130 years ago.

431
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,840
Patience!

432
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,179
I'm not even exaggerating. That is literally what it is.

433
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,720
She is loony.

434
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,179
Well, I think we figured out what's up with the water bills.

435
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,679
Mark says the fountain is leaking.

436
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,480
Just hundreds of dollars dripping into the ground.

437
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,519
And the fascinating saga of the water bill continues.

438
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,519
Will they patch the pipes? Stay tuned.

439
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,679
Babe, Sas and Isaac escaped Patience's clutches.

440
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,779
They're back. Oh, nice.

441
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:28,519
You see, sometimes this ghost stuff just resolves itself.

442
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,940
That's a good lesson for the future.

443
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,279
Wait a minute. Dripping?

444
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,500
Isaac, remember the dripping in Patience's lair?

445
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,459
Patience's lair must be under the fountain.

446
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,539
What? She's been 50 feet away this entire time?

447
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,659
Oh, now that creeps me all the way out.

448
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:43,659
You know, if Patience's feelings were really hurt,

449
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:46,720
now you can do something about it. We know where she is.

450
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,379
Hey, just to clarify, are you suggesting going and getting

451
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,459
the creepy, feral Puritan ghost and bringing her into the house?

452
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:57,019
I'm suggesting righting a wrong that happened a long time ago.

453
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,720
Wow, and you wouldn't even let me get a lizard.

454
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,900
May I just remind you that this lunatic kidnapped and held us hostage?

455
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,620
Yeah, she was hurting, Isaac. And also she let us go.

456
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,080
Wait, you were kidnapped by a worm?

457
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,280
I may regret this, but I feel we need to go get Patience.

458
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,120
Patience is very creepy, but for no pain of abandonment,

459
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,580
would not wish that on any Nandane.

460
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,160
Isaac, you were literally just saying that if we got out of there,

461
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
you'd turn over a new leaf and be a better person.

462
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Well, here's your chance.

463
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,340
Yes, perhaps we could start with something smaller.

464
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,880
I could compliment one of Samantha's dreadful sweaters.

465
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,880
That looks...

466
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
lovely.

467
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Isaac.

468
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Okay, fine, fine.

469
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Let's go get that scary Puritan woman.

470
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,340
Jay, we may need to destroy the fountain, but...

471
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,259
Please don't finish that sentence.

472
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:56,980
No, I got a better idea. I'm a guy with great legs and a great idea.

473
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Wow, Jay, this is actually really cool.

474
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,700
They formed a human chain or, you know, a ghost chain.

475
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,660
Once again, Sam, we're still human. We're just dead.

476
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,940
This is the most amazing sight I've never seen.

477
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,859
You see, back at Camper Ma, I was anchor of my tug-of-war team.

478
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,740
Three years running, we got first at the Maccabia games.

479
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Okay.

480
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,339
I'll take Crash's hand.

481
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,460
At least we know he cannot sneeze.

482
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,460
Yeah, yeah, keep going. Into the dirt.

483
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
I hate this!

484
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
Ah!

485
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Wee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

486
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Whoa! Now we stop. Stop. Stop. Pull out! Pull out!

487
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,180
No, the ghost got pulled into the dirt.

488
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,259
Oh, no.

489
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,460
Yes! Steve Money and his magic quads!

490
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
Yeah! Suck it, Thor!

491
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Thor's way up there.

492
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Pass it on!

493
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Suck it, Thor! Pass it on!

494
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,180
Suck it, Thor! Pass it on!

495
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,180
Suck it, Thor! Pass it on!

496
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,180
Patience! We came back!

497
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Isaacs, Sasapis, what is the meaning of this?

498
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,180
We're not gonna abandon you again. Come with us!

499
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,019
Ah!

500
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,460
Oh, sorry! Sorry!

501
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:18,180
I got him! We're good. We're good. Look, we know we messed up, but you're our friend.

502
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,180
And you're not a lunatic.

503
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,900
My point is we'd like you to come back to the house with us.

504
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
You came back for me?

505
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Not soon enough.

506
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Patience! Patience!

507
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Oh! So it can be good or bad. That's interesting.

508
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,180
Come with me if you want to live.

509
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,900
Terminator. It's a movie. A movie's like a series of images.

510
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Can we do this back at the house?

511
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,620
Suck it, Thor! Pass it on.

512
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
Wait.

513
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,620
Hey, Jay. If I were kidnapped and trapped in an underground lair,

514
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,620
would you risk an eternity in the dirt for the chance to save me?

515
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Ooh, of course. And I love that these are our hypotheticals.

516
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Mm.

517
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,620
Well?

518
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,340
Oh, sorry, bro. It's a no-go on the tiles.

519
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,500
Our investor wants to see other options.

520
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,019
I mean, Burgundy.

521
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,740
Are we opening a restaurant or a brothel?

522
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Okay.

523
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,940
I'll find some more options.

524
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,700
Sorry, Mark.

525
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,660
By the way, how's Patience adapting to life in the house?

526
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,220
I think it's going really well.

527
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,740
One last question for the...

528
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,740
What is thy favorite color?

529
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,299
Ugh, I did not sign up for this.

530
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,579
Patience! Patience!

531
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,019
Ah! Purple!

532
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:37,019
Oh.

533
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,740
h Apple music!

534
00:20:45,740 --> 00:21:04,259
żeby去 sokной

535
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:34,240
Thank you.
